The following is a map of Japan and nearby islands. It is divided by province, 
with the exception of Hokkaido, which was divided into 8 regions. The names of
the players (with the exception of 1) all have significane in Japanese history.
Gameplay is resonable, albeit a little lopsided with respect to the strength of
Hokkaido and the minor islands.
