# Fracas

An attempt to remake [this game](http://www.smozzie.com/fracas.html)

Try the early terrible version [here](http://fracas.caseyhoward.net)

## Todo

- Mobile mouse events
- Multiplayer via internet
- Map builder
- Sound effects
- Single player (AI)
- Log
- Stats
- Random map generator
- Allies
- Multiplayer chat
- Troop count rendering (better centering and better font)
- Use elm-svg instead of elm-collage (wish I knew about that before)


## Bugs
- Don't show available moves when showing country info
- Make sure there are more countries on a map than players when starting game
- Hide "Add Player" Button when colors are used up
